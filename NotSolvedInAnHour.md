#### (1) Smallest sequence with given Primes
> Given three prime number(p1, p2, p3) and an integer k. Find the first(smallest) k integers which have only p1, p2, p3 or a combination of them as their prime factors. Example:  
>
> Input :  
> Prime numbers : [2,3,5] k : 5  
> Output:  
> If primes are given as p1=2, p2=3 and p3=5 and k is given as 5, then the sequence of first 5 integers will be:
> {2,3,4,5,6}  
> Explanation :  
> 4 = p1 * p1 ( 2 * 2 ) 6 = p1 * p2 ( 2 * 3 )  
> Note: The sequence should be sorted in ascending order

#### (2) Vertex Cover Problem
> A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that for every edge (u, v) of the graph, either ‘u’ or ‘v’ is in vertex cover.  
> Given a binary tree with N nodes, find and return the minimum of nodes in its vertex cover.
